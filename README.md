Shortcodes Bootstrap
====================

This repository was forked from https://wordpress.org/plugins/dw-shortcodes-bootstrap/ because it has not updated in over a year, and it appears the original creators are no longer maintaining this.  

This is a plugin that is being used on one or more of our websites, so it was updated in order to maintain functionality after updating to Wordpress 4.  

TinyMCE was updated in Wordpress 3.9, which broke the original plugin's functionality.
